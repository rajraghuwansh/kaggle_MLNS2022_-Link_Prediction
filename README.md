# kaggle_MLNS2022_-Link_Prediction
â€”The object of this project is a directed graph where
the nodes represent scientific articles and an edge indicates that
its tail cites its head. Given that some of the edges of the graph
have been removed, the purpose of our project is to be able to
retrieve them. This can be seen as a classification problem which
takes a pair of articles as input and outputs one if there should
be an edge between them, zero otherwise. To solve this problem
we will build a model based on metadata related to the articles,
textual information from the titles and abstracts as well as graph
related features.
